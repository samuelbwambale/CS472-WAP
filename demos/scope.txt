var x = 10;
function main() {
	console.log("x1 is " + x);
	x = 20;
	console.log("x2 is " + x);
	if(x > 0) {
		var x = 30;
		console.log("x3 is " + x);
	}
	console.log("x4 is " + x);
	var x = 40;
	var f = function(x) {
		console.log("x5 is " + x);
	};
	f(50);
	console.log("x6 is " + x);
}
main();
console.log("x7 is " + x);

Here is how you execute/evaluate the correct output/result (Remember to do 2 phase execution - hoisting before exec):

First, in the Global Lexical Environment:

	Phase 1 - hoisting a.k.a creation of the lexical env:

		var x = undefined
		var main = [function(){}]

	Phase 2 - Execution/Evaluation of statements and expressions
		
		x = 10
		calls main();
	
		Next, in the main() function's Lexical Environment:	
		
			Phase 1 - hoisting a.k.a creation of the lexical env:
			
				var x = undefined
				var f = undefined
			
			Phase 2 - Execution/Evaluation of statements and expressions
			
				console.log("x1 is " + x); // "x1 is undefined"
				x = 20;
				console.log("x2 is " + x); // "x2 is 20"
				if(x > 0) { // true
					x = 30; // assigns that same x the new value, 30
					console.log("x3 is " + x); // "x3 is 30"
				}
				console.log("x4 is " + x); // "x4 is 30"
				x = 40; // assigns that same x the new value, 40 
				f = function(x) { // assigns the function to f
					console.log("x5 is " + x);
				};
				f(50); // calls f passing in as argument, the value 50
				
				Next, in the f() function's Lexical Environment:
				
					Phase 1 - hoisting a.k.a creation of the lexical env:
						// No variable or function declaration found; so nothing to hoist here
					
					Phase 2 - Execution/Evaluation of statements and expressions
						x = 50; // as a result of the function's x parameter being assigned the value 50 at function call
						console.log("x5 is " + x); // "x5 is 50"
						// Finishes and Exits f() function
				
				// Back into main function
				console.log("x6 is " + x); // "x6 is 40" -- Note: That was the last value we assigned to x at line 52 above
				
				// Finishes and Exits main() function		
		
		// Back to Execution/Evaluation of statements and expressions in the Global Lexical Environment		
		console.log("x7 is " + x); // "x7 is 10" // -- See line 32 above showing the last value assigned to x in global		
		
======================================================================

Therefore, the final output of the JavaScript code fragment will be:

"x1 is undefined"
"x2 is 20"
"x3 is 30"
"x4 is 30"
"x5 is 50"
"x6 is 40"	
"x7 is 10"
